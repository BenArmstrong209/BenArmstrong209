  <p>Here is a list of games we typically perform at our shows! Give them a look and try them out at parties!</p>
  <h1>Party Quirks</h1>
    <p>Number of Performers: 4</p>
    <p>How to Play: One person plays the host to a house party, and the other three performers arrive one by one as guests. However, each guest has been given a personality quirk/trait by the audience that the host doesn’t know. The goal of the game is for the host to correctly guess what each guests’ quirk is, all while keeping the party going!</p>

<h1>Scenes from a Hat</h1>
<p>Number of Performers: Everyone</p>
<p>How to Play: Before the game begins, audience members write down small prompts that we place into a hat. Prompts usually consist of phrases like “Dating me is like BLANK” or “What you can say about BLANK, but not your significant other”. One member of the team then randomly selects these prompts, which the entire team will use to come up with short quips and jokes.</p>

<h1>Ding</h1>
<p>Number of Performers: 4</p>
<p>How to Play: After getting a prompt from the audience, typically a location or word, three performers will act out a scene based on that prompt. However, one performer will stand off to the side, around with a bell. At any point in the scene, they can ding the bell, and the last person to talk must immediately go back and say something completely different. </p>

<h1>ABCs</h1>
<p>Number of Performers: 2-3</p>
<p>How to Play: Performers first get a location from the audience to base the scene on, and then get a letter of the alphabet from them too. The performers then act out the scene, but they must begin the first line with a word starting with that letter, and then the next line must begin with the letter that comes after the previous one, and so on and so forth.</p>

<h1>Freeze</h1>
<p>Number of Performers: Everyone</p>
<p>How to Play: Two performers get a prompt from the audience and begin to act out a scene based on it. However, at any point, one of the other performers not in the scene can yell “Freeze!” and those currently acting the scene must stop moving and hold whatever pose they had. The one who yelled freeze can then replaced one of the performers, taking the same pose they had, and start a brand new scene.</p>

<h1>Director’s Cut</h1>
<p>Number of Performers: 4</p>
<p>How to Play: Three performers take on the role of actors in a film, while one is the director. After getting a setting for the film to take place in, the three performers act out a scene from this fake movie until the director calls “cut”. The director then gives their own take on how the performance went, and suggests something that the actors can do something differently, like “do that scene, but you’re in space” or “act it out like a foreign film”.</p>
